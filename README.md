# Object-Detection-By-Using-Yolo-Technology
This project uses YOLOv8 for real-time object detection from images, videos, and live webcam. Built with Django and OpenCV, it highlights detected objects with labels and stores results in a database. Users can upload files, view results, and track detection history via a simple web interface.
